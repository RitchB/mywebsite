Hi!

Today I want to share my journey to conquer the fear of failure.

I recently recorded my very first video for Youtube, discussing my experience with the fear of failure and how it held me back from achieving some of my goals. (Not posted yet but it will be in the coming weeks)

According to recent studies, nearly one in three people experience an intense fear of failure. This fear is especially prevalent among those aged 18 to 34. Living with this constant fear can negatively impact our mental health, causing symptoms like depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and difficulty concentrating. As someone who has struggled with overthinking and procrastination, I decided to face my fears and take action. I hope that you can do the same.

I want to share 4 tips that have helped me overcome my anxiety and move closer to my goals based on my own experiences:


## 1. Identify your fears

I took the time to get specific about what scared me. By writing my worries down and discussing them with a therapist, I created an action plan tailored to my needs. When I focused on my happiness, solutions began to emerge. The goal is to focus on taking action toward your objectives or what you want to achieve.

## 2. Start small

I realized that achieving success is more of a process or a direction than a destination. You can only start going in that direction if you start. But no need to bite off more than you can chew. I began by taking small steps toward my goals. I have been contemplating starting a Youtube channel for months, and the fear of not being good enough and receiving negative comments from people I know was crippling me. So I started small. I did post a short video on YouTube two months ago. It was a 17 seconds Shorts where we couldn't see my face. The goal was to prove that nobody cared about me trying different things, and thus nobody would laugh at me for doing that. I'm also very critical of the quality of what I do, so by making a brief video, I was in a position where I could lower my expectations and embrace the process of going over my fear. I learned that facing my fears isn't life-threatening.

## 3. Practice relaxation techniques

To help overcome fear, I incorporated breathing exercises and meditation into my daily routine. Do I do it each day? No. Should I? probably! I learned that breathing, even for five minutes, activates your parasympathetic nervous system, leading to relaxation and calmness. As a result, I became more focused and less easily distracted, making it easier to take action toward my goals.

## 4. Seek support

I talked to friends, family, and a therapist to help overcome my fears. This support provided valuable insights and new perspectives. Seeking help is a sign of strength and courage, not weakness. My therapist gave me useful tips to cope with my anxiety. Consulting a therapist is for me something I wish I had done sooner.

Dale Carnegie once said,

>"Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage."

It's normal to experience fear, but it's essential not to let it hold us back from achieving our dreams. If you're scared to start something new, maybe it's time for you to take action. Remember that everything is a process, and the process requires a plan. What's your plan?

Wishing you courage and success,
